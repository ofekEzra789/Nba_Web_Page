                        <h2><a href="">An intern no more, Darius Bazley is ready for the NBA challenge</a></h2><br>
                        <p>"You get some people here and there they'll just ask you about it, 'Yo, like how was it not
                            going to college?'" Bazley told ESPN recently. "I know when I was going through the whole
                            pre-draft process traveling from team to team before we'd go out and work out, [the other
                            players would] all be talking about college. And someone would pop up and say, 'Well, how
                            was it, just sitting out?'"</p>
                        <p>It was a little more than a year ago when Bazley decided to forgo a scholarship at Syracuse
                            for a potential path to the NBA via the G League. He then opted to skip the G League as well
                            to instead focus on preparing for the draft.</p>

                            <h2><a href="">How can the Lakers replace DeMarcus Cousins?</a></h2><br>
                            <p>Given that Cousins was penciled in as the starting center for a Lakers team with
                                championship aspirations after adding Anthony Davis to team with LeBron James, the
                                injury has important ramifications for the Lakers and the rest of the league. It's also
                                another blow for Cousins, who was still working back toward full health after an
                                Achilles rupture in January 2018.</p>
                            <p>Fresh off of inking a $100 million contract extension to remain with the Warriors, Green
                                sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols in Las Vegas to discuss what the new deal means to
                                him, how he found out Durant was leaving and what's next for this franchise. Here's part
                                of that interview.</p>

                            <p>With free agency largely wrapped up and most rosters nearing completion, it's time to
                                look ahead to the upcoming NBA campaign with the help of our projections based on ESPN's
                                real plus-minus (RPM). This is our fourth season using RPM for projections, which have
                                correctly picked teams' preseason lines 57.5% of the time in that span.</p><br>
                            <p>While the beauty of sports is the impossibility of predicting everything that will
                                unfold, RPM projections have offered a better starting point for expectations about the
                                season to come. So, after answering a few key questions about them, let's take a look at
                                what RPM forecasts for 2019-20.</p>

                                <p>MADISON, N.J. -- Ferguson Recreation Center is a nondescript brick building on the
                                    edge of Fairleigh Dickinson University's campus, which is as quiet as one would
                                    expect for a Sunday morning in August. A charter bus sits unoccupied along Dreyfuss
                                    Road across from the Division III gym, the only clue that something is happening
                                    inside.</p><br>
                                <p>Then, from the building's rotunda entrance, a fully uniformed Boston Celtic bounds
                                    toward the street. He needs something from the bus.</p>
